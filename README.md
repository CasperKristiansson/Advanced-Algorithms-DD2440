# Advanced-Algorithms-DD2440
## Course contents
The course will describe and analyze a number of algorithms for combinatorial computational problems. Algorithmic concepts: Randomized algorithms, approximation algorithms, fixed-parameter algorithms.

## Intended learning outcomes
After passing the course, the student should be able to:
- Explain different advanced algorithmic concepts such as randomized algorithms, approximation algorithms, fixed-parameter algorithms
- Analyze, select, use, and verify algorithms that are based on the above concepts,
- Develop efficient algorithms that are based on the above concepts,
- Independently explore existing advanced algorithms, implement them, and improve them using heuristics,
- Communicate algorithmic ideas in a clear, formal way
